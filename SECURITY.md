# CryptoLib Security

`cryptolib` is the cryptographic primitive library used by `versionlib`/`ssh_lib`.
It is pure Ada 2022 (Alire/GNAT) with no OpenSSL dependency; the test harness's
cross-check vectors were generated offline and are embedded, not linked at
runtime. This document records the security
properties the code actually provides, how they are verified, and the known
limitations. It describes the code as implemented — not aspirational goals.

## Algorithms and reference vectors

Every primitive is validated against published test vectors in
`tests/src/tests.adb` (run: `(cd tests && alr build) && ./tests/bin/tests`).
The reference sources are:

| Area | Algorithms | Verified against |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| Hashes | MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256/384/512, SHA3-256/512, SHAKE128/256 | NIST / RFC KATs |
| MAC / KDF | HMAC-SHA1/256/384/512, PBKDF2, PBKDF1, PKCS12KDF, bcrypt_pbkdf, UMAC-64/128 | RFC 2202 / 4231 / 6070; RFC 4418 (UMAC); bcrypt proven by decrypting a real OpenSSH key |
| AEAD / ciphers | AES-128/192/256 (CTR/CBC/GCM), ChaCha20-Poly1305, 3DES, RC2 | FIPS-197; AES-256-GCM and chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com cross-checked vs pyca/OpenSSL |
| GHASH | GF(2¹²⁸) for AES-GCM | via the GCM KAT |
| X25519 | Curve25519 ECDH | RFC 7748 §5.2 |
| Ed25519 | sign / verify | RFC 8032 |
| ECDSA | P-256 (in `ssh_lib`), P-384 / P-521 sign | **RFC 6979 A.2.5** (P-384, byte-exact) + P-521 (pyca cross-verified) |
| Finite-field DH | groups 1 / 14 / 16 / 18 | live vs OpenSSH; group16/18 pin the exact RFC 3526 primes |
| Post-quantum | ML-KEM-768, sntrup761 (+ hybrid x25519 KEX) | NIST / live vs OpenSSH sntrup761x25519 |

## Constant-time properties

The following operate on secret data and are implemented without secret-dependent
branches, memory indexing, or variable-latency arithmetic:

- **AES** (`Ciphers`) — the S-box is **bit-sliced** (`affine(x²⁵⁴)` over GF(2⁸)
  with branchless field arithmetic and a public fixed exponent). There is **no
  S-box lookup table** in the binary, so there is no cache-timing side channel.
  `Xtime`/`Gmul` and the GF(2¹²⁸) **GHASH** multiply are branchless (mask, not
  `if`) — relevant because GHASH runs on the GCM authentication subkey.
- **Finite-field DH** (`Modexp`) — fixed-width Montgomery modular exponentiation,
  square-and-multiply-**always** over a fixed iteration count (the public
  exponent byte length), branchless conditional subtract/select.
- **ECDSA** (`EC_Arith` + `ECDSA`) — fixed-width Montgomery field arithmetic
  (branchless add/sub/select), Renes–Costello–Batina **complete** projective
  point addition (no exceptional cases), a fixed-length **double-and-add-always**
  scalar ladder with branchless point select, and `k⁻¹`/`Z⁻¹` via Fermat through
  the constant-time `Modexp`. The RFC 6979 nonce candidate check is branchless.
- **Ed25519** (`Ed25519`) — signing uses always-add scalar multiplication with
  branchless field/`mod L` reduction. (Verification runs on public data.)
- **X25519** (`Curve25519`) — Montgomery ladder with arithmetic conditional swap;
  the all-zero (low-order-point) shared secret is rejected per RFC 7748 / the SSH
  curve25519 KEX.
- **sntrup761** (`SNTRUP761`) — `mod`/hardware-division freezes replaced by
  branchless Barrett multiply-shift; decapsulation selects and rho-substitutes
  branchlessly (constant-time implicit rejection).
- **ML-KEM-768** — the FO re-encryption compare uses `Constant_Time.Equal`.
- **Authentication-tag comparison** — `Constant_Time.Equal` (accumulate-OR,
  no early return) is used for GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, and the ML-KEM check.

### Caveats (read these)

- Constant-timeness is enforced at the **Ada source level** (branchless masks),
  not by `pragma Suppress` or a verification tool. It was spot-checked with
  `objdump` (e.g. `CT_Select` compiles to zero conditional jumps; the jumps in
  `Mont_Mul`/`Pack`/`Unpack` are loop counters and input-independent GNAT range
  checks). A compiler upgrade could in principle reintroduce a branch; there is
  **no automated CT regression gate**.
- AES is **bit-sliced, not AES-NI** — it eliminates the cache-timing channel but
  is slower than hardware AES (the deliberate correctness/side-channel tradeoff).
- `Constant_Time_Proof` is a **declarative manifest, not an automated proof**.

## Secret zeroization

`Secure_Wipe.Wipe (Address, Length)` overwrites memory through a
`Volatile_Components` overlay, so the store **cannot be elided** by the optimizer
(unlike a plain `X := [others => 0]`, which `-O3` removes as a dead store — a real
bug this replaced). It needs no libc/OS primitive, so it is portable.

It scrubs sntrup761 key material (recip/keygen work arrays) and the ECDSA signer's
long-term private scalar, per-signature nonce, `k⁻¹`, and HMAC-DRBG state.
Zeroization is **not comprehensive** across every primitive's ephemeral buffers;
it targets the highest-value long-term-key and nonce material.

## Randomness

`Random` in `Production_Mode` delegates to `OS_Random.Fill_OS`, selected per OS
by the project file (`src-linux` / `src-windows`):

- **Linux** — `getrandom(2)` (blocks until the kernel CSPRNG is seeded),
  `/dev/urandom` fallback.
- **Windows** — `BCryptGenRandom` with `BCRYPT_USE_SYSTEM_PREFERRED_RNG`.

The RNG **fails closed**: if no OS source is available it returns
`Internal_Error` and zeroes the buffer rather than emitting weak randomness.
`Deterministic_Mode` / `Failing_Mode` exist only for reproducible tests.

## Known limitations

- **Windows RNG and `Secure_Wipe`** are written to the documented Windows APIs
  but have **not been built, linked, or run on Windows** from this repo — they
  pass an Alire GNAT semantic check off Windows only and need a Windows CI pass.
- **No AES-NI / hardware acceleration** (see the CT caveat above).
- GNAT `Ada.Numerics.Big_Numbers.Big_Integers` caps at ~6400 bits, which is why
  DH group16/18 use `Modexp` (fixed-width Montgomery) rather than `Big_Integers`.
- CT holds at the source level only; there is no formal or automated guarantee.

## Test coverage

- **Known-answer tests** for every algorithm above, cross-checked against RFC/NIST
  vectors and (for AEAD/PQ) pyca/OpenSSL or live OpenSSH.
- **Negative / fail-closed tests**: Ed25519 rejects a non-canonical `S` (`S ≥ L`)
  and short signatures/keys; X25519 rejects an all-zero (low-order) peer point;
  ChaCha20-Poly1305 `Open` rejects tampered ciphertext and tampered tags.
- **`Secure_Wipe`** has a unit test asserting a filled buffer is zeroed.

Run the suite: `(cd tests && alr build) && ./tests/bin/tests` (expects
`cryptolib tests passed`).
